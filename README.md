 The scatter plot from 1960 shows severe differences between the regions in life expectancy at birth as well as
 in fertility rate. However, it visualizes a clear trend which says: the higher the fertility rate, the lower the
 life expectancy at birth. The region with the highest life expectancy and the lowest fertility rate in 1960 is
 Europe, which is mainly caused by the high health standards that Europe already had back then. One outlier is 
 noticeable from the Europe region and that is the country of Turkey which is the only country of the region that has
 a life expectancy of less than 60 (45.38 years). The reason for that is that Turkey mainly belongs to Asia and if
 you would change the region to Asia it would not be an outlier, in fact it would fit perfectly in the average of 
 Asia.The countries of America are spread all over the scatter plot. There are countries like Canada and the US 
 that are within the values of the European countries but there are also many countries that have a life expectancy
 of less than 50 and a fertility rate above 6. By taking a second look at the values of the Americas, it becomes 
 obvious that the countries of South America are mainly the ones that can be found in the lower right half of the
 scatter plot. This is due to the bad development that most of the countries had 64 years ago.
 On the other hand, Africa has on average the lowest life expectancy but the highest fertility rate. The lowest 
 life expectancy belongs to Mali, a country that had a really bad time during the 50s and 60s.
 There are two more noticeable outliers from the Africa region. One has the highest fertility rate out of all 
 countries and the other one has the lowest fertility rate by far out of all African countries. The highest 
 fertility rate belongs to the country of Rwanda with an average of 8.19 and the lowest one of Africa is Gabon 
 with an average of 4.38. The regions of Oceania and the Middle East for the most part represent the average of 
 all regions. 
 
 The scatter plot from 2020 shows lower differences in both, the life expectancy at birth as well as in the fertility
 rate. The difference between the highest and lowest life expectancy is now about 35 years, and the difference 
 between the highest and lowest fertility rate is only from below two to 7 instead of more than 8 in 1960. It is 
 noticeable that by 2020 many Asian countries have increased their life expectancy and are now together with Europe 
 in the top tier. Actually, on average every country increased their life expectancy and lowered their fertility rate.
 The highest life expectancy in 1960 was from Norway in Europe, in 2020 it now is Hong Kong in Asia. Now two of 
 the top three life expectancies are from Asia. The biggest development was made by the Americas region who could
 not only increase their life expectancy by far but also heavily lowered their average fertility rates by almost
 half.
 
 It is remarkable that in 1960 there were 30 countries with a life expectancy of less than 40, whereas in 2020 there
 were only two countries with a lower life expectancy than 50! In 1960 more than 20 countries had a fertility rate
 of more than 7, in 2020 it was only 1. The highest life expectancy was around 74 (in 1960) and increased to 30 
countries having a higher life expectancy at birth than 80 years. The biggest evolutions were made in terms of
the fertility rate. In 1960 only three countries had a fertility rate lower than 2, in 2020 there were 70 countries.
Most of these changes can be explained by an economic boom and major developments in the healthcare.
